âœ… Install via pip (Command Prompt)

Run these once in CMD:

pip install selenium


(Optional but useful)

pip install webdriver-manager


â†’ This auto-downloads the correct Edge driver when Selenium runs (so you donâ€™t have to keep updating manually).

âœ… Manual Download (if not using webdriver-manager)

You need Microsoft Edge WebDriver (msedgedriver.exe) that matches your installed Edge browser version exactly.

Check your Edge version:

Open Edge â†’ click ... â†’ Help and Feedback â†’ About Microsoft Edge

Example: Version 139.0.xxxx.x

Download the matching Edge WebDriver from Microsoftâ€™s official site:
ðŸ‘‰ https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/

Extract msedgedriver.exe and place it into:

C:\Users\Admin\python code\repos\


(or any folder, but then update your scriptâ€™s DRIVER_PATH accordingly)

âœ… Nothing Else Needed

time, random, threading â†’ built into Python (no install needed).

winsound â†’ built into Python on Windows (no install needed).

âš¡ So in short:

At minimum: pip install selenium

Then either:

Use webdriver-manager (easy, no manual driver updates), OR

Manually download and place msedgedriver.exe that matches your Edge version
